All of the codes are reused from each exercise, this means the modules used are the same.
These Modules are needed to run the programs.

Requirements:
Pygame(pip3 install pygame)
Pillow(pip3 install pillow)
Python Text To Speech(pyttsx3)(pip3 install pyttsx3)


Directory Issues:
All the assets are outside for a reason.
Python doesn't find the file if they're in the same folder, so I had to resort to moving them all outside, and for some reason it works.
The assets would be compiled all together if the Directories work as they should.

Notes: 
Progress of the codes can be seen from the commits as I cloned the Github Classroom Repository to my local system.
This means that I regularly push code when I make progress through each Exercise.
Canvas was regularly used as the main frame for the programs to run.
Additionally, the rough layouts were first made in Figma for visualization

There are music and sound effects for each exercise, some reusing the same sfx(such as the click sound).
Each part of the code is made with functions, as they can easily get called every time.
