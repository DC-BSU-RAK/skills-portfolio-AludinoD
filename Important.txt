All of the codes are reused from each exercise, this means the modules used are the same.
These Modules are needed to run the programs.

Requirements:
Pygame
Pillow
Python Text To Speech(pyttsx3)

Directory Issues:
All the assets are outside for a reason.
Python doesn't find the file if they're in the same folder, so I had to resort to moving them all outside, and for some reason it works.
The assets would be compiled all together if the Directories work as they should.

Notes: 
Progress of the codes can be seen from the commits as I cloned the Github Classroom Repository to my local system.
This means that I regularly push code when I make progress through each Exercise.
